# OrderManagementSystem
This is a basic OMS C# program which utilises an SQL database (provided) that consists of stock items, orders, order headers, etc. 
<br>Using a simple WPF UI built in C#, the "orders received" can then be processed by the "warehouse".
<br>The application automatically updates the SQL database & calculates the price of the order.
